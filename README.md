# Titanic_Survivors_Analysis_Decision_Tree
### Overview
- This project involves the analysis of the Titanic dataset, exploring factors influencing survival, and building a machine learning model for prediction. The repository includes data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and model deployment.
### Top 5 Challenges and Solutions
 - Dealing with Missing Data
### Challenge: The dataset contained missing values, especially in the 'Age' and 'Cabin' columns, impacting the analysis and model training.
Solution: I addressed missing values in the 'Age' column by filling them with the mean age. The 'Cabin' column was dropped due to a high number of missing values. Imputation and strategic column removal ensured a cleaner dataset.
### Feature Engineering
Challenge: Selecting relevant features for the model was crucial. Deciding which columns to keep or drop required careful consideration.
Solution: I dropped unimportant features like 'PassengerId', 'Name', and others based on their limited impact on predicting survival. Feature importance analysis guided the selection process, enhancing the model's effectiveness.
## Data Encoding
Challenge: The 'Sex' column contained categorical values, and machine learning models require numerical inputs.
Solution: I used LabelEncoder to convert 'Sex' values to numerical format (Male: 1, Female: 0), ensuring compatibility with the machine learning algorithm.
## Model Selection and Training
Challenge: Choosing an appropriate model and training it effectively for accurate predictions posed a challenge.
Solution: I selected a Decision Tree Classifier as the model. Careful evaluation on both training and test sets ensured that the model achieved reasonable accuracy, balancing performance and generalization.
## Model Deployment
Challenge: Deploying the model and creating a user-friendly interface for predictions required careful scripting.
Solution: I created a deployment script that takes user input for features ('Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'Fare') and outputs a prediction for survival. This script enables users to interact with the model and obtain predictions for individual passengers.
